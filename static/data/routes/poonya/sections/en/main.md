# Poonya
Poonya is a relatively lightweight templating engine (70KB is the size of a compressed poonya bundle) that is not targeted at a specific use case. You can use it for your chatbot project, or you can use it to render web pages. You can also use poonya in the browser and write templates directly in the html page.

Poonya was written by me because I needed a text template engine for one of my projects. It all started with the task of writing a chat bot, I did not like the use of regular expressions to compose the bot's response, since they did not allow to fully implement the text output logic. I decided to write a text template engine for this purpose.

## About name ~[about_name]
In general, there is no hidden meaning in the name, I just love animals. The Chinese called poonya itself a fiery fox, which sounded like "hon ho". Another name was "cat bear". The inhabitants of Nepal called this animal "poonya" and it was from this word that the name "panda" came from, and it was this name that was insolently used by me to name this project.

For a long period of time, the small (red) panda was either singled out into a separate family, then attributed to the bear family, then attributed to raccoons. The confusion was caused by the fact that the movements of the red panda are similar to those of a bear: just like he can sit on his hind limbs, he has good command of the fore limbs, climbs trees, screams and gets angry. But at the same time, in appearance it is very similar to a striped raccoon. The resemblance to raccoons was enhanced by similarities in the structure of the skull, tail and teeth, and DNA analysis indicated a relationship with bears.

You can try punya on the same site. To do this, you can go to the main page, then go to projects, and under the poonya heading there will be a `demo` button, by clicking which a window will open in which you can enter the poonya code and instantly receive the output.
