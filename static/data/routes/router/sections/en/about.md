# About
The site is hosted on GitHub pages, which I think is clear from the name. I own it [AseWhy](https://github.com/AseWhy/). The name contains two aliases, I usually use them when registering for various services. The site was created for routing documentation, which, in the future, may become quite a lot. It took two days to create it, but its development was all spent after those two days. Now the site weighs about 500kb, compressed, and loads quite quickly, I'm happy with that. This site costs me exactly 0 rubles.

### Technologies
When creating this site, the [**Vue.js**](https://vuejs.org/) framework was used as the basis of the site, [**markedjs**](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for parsing `Markdown` and [**highlight.js**](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting in places where it is needed, the css framework [**bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make styling some elements easier. This whole thing was put together by the webpack builder, and now we have what we have.

### Sections
If you briefly go through the sections, then in the section `Documentation`, I will store links to my documentation and specifications (if any). In the section 'About this site' you can read general information about this site. In the section `Projects` there will be a list of my projects.

### Why are the pictures above?
There is absolutely no need, it just seemed to me that it looks more interesting than without them. If it puts a heavy load on your GPU or you don't like it, then you can click <span a-hook='ImageHandler.chStatusAll' class='contentlink'> here </span>
