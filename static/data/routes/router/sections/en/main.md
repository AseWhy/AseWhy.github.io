# Shortly about myself
I am 18 years old (born in 2002 from birth of christ.), I am in college. At the moment, on the 3rd year of the specialty `technician-programmer`. I am fond of programming, I love animals, I finish this site and a couple of my projects at night. I became interested in programming at the age of nine, since then I have tried many different languages ​​and frameworks. I have experience with git at the level create a branch, commit, push, familiar with the concept of git flow. I heard about docker in legends, but in practice I haven’t had a chance to use it yet. I can work with linux without ui, I know OOP firsthand and how to set up your microwave. I don’t know much, but I can do something. And in general, I am a useful person, what can we say)

I have experience with several programming languages:
* C/C++
* Java
* C #
* PHP
* JavaScript
* Python
* Pascal
* Delphi
* GLSL
* Lua

> (!) This does not mean that I know each of these languages well, just at one time I tried to write in them

After fooling around with the above, I settled on JavaScript and have been writing on it for the last 2 years, I have the following stack:
