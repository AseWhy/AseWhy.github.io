### Updates
Here I'll just leave the timeline with site updates. If you missed them (how is it possible at all), then here you can see what happened while you were gone.

> [$] The beginning of all beginnings {}

> [22/01/2021] Added update section {
    Today I added a section with updates, where you can see all the updates that have occurred to the site. Also, the pictures on top were changed, the old ones bored me. I decided to put something brighter. Also the documentation for `Poonya` has been updated, some spelling errors have been fixed. `42`
}

> [26/01/2021] Added localization system {
    Today I added a system whereby, for this site, it will be possible to select a language. Therefore, in the shortest possible time, content translated by google translators will appear in different languages. I also added micro-markup and fixed some minor errors.
}

> [06.02.2021] Updating images on top {
    Today the images in the site header have been updated, as well as minor changes on the home page. Fixed a bug where the updated post overlapped the banner with translation information
}
