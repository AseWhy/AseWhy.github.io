# Briefly about me
Welcome to my site! My name is **Plekhanov** **Alexey**, by father **Mikhailovich**. Me `{{Math. floor((new Date()-new Date("2002/06/21"))/31557600000) }}` years, year, i don't know), this is computed from my date of birth. At the moment, I am studying, or maybe I am not studying in college, in the specialty 'programmer technician'. I am fond of programming, and during my existence I tried many different frameworks, libraries and engines. I tried to write games, to be honest, it didn't work very well. At the moment, I have decided on ' web ' development, and although not for commercial purposes, I have been doing it for the last 2 years.

### What I can do
* Understand the relational model of building a database. Naturally, I am familiar with `Mysql`, so I also had to work with `MongoDB`
* I understand someone else's code, I can work with someone else's code even without special comments, and I try to comment everything carefully myself.
* I understand the principles of building the `REST API`, although I prefer the `JSON Pure API`. But I have nothing against `REST`.
* I can work with docker/compos, git, at a sufficient level for team development.
* Understand the client-server architecture.
* I can work with `vk`(`discord`) **api**. I used to write bots in self's time.
* If you didn't have the skill you needed above, then it doesn't matter, I'm learning quite a bit, at least at the time of writing this page.

### My stack
To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to write here, so I'll write everything I've worked with for the last 2 years, and of course with this I can do something not trivial.

I also have experience in writing VK chatbots, I have experience with `vk.api`. I understand the paradigms of building `REST API` but prefer` JSON Pure API` to it. If you have a project in mind, you can write to me here [**here**](mailto:astecom@mailru). Also, if we are talking about inclusion in an already developed project, then there will be no problems with this - **I can understand someone else's code**. I have 2021 years of development experience, of which 7 years are real, and 1 month commercial).
