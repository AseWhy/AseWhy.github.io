# List of projects
In addition to this site, I have a few more projects that I have designed/developed. Here you can find links to representations of these projects, where you can read about them in more detail.

#### [**Poonya**](https://github.com/AseWhy/Poonya) - Text preprocessor.
Nothing fancy, simple, less lightweight text preprocessor. Can be used both on the client and on the server (NodeJS). Of the features, it can be noted that it is not aimed at working with any format and was created exclusively for preliminary text processing. Also, it is quite fast if you use it on the server, and although there are still problems with optimizing its work on the client, they will be gradually fixed

#### [**VoxReader**](https://github.com/AseWhy/Vox-Reader-JS) - A library for reading the .vox format in js.
.vox - format for storing and transferring voxel models of the VoxEdit editor. The library, when transferring to it the binary data of a file (an already read file into a byte array), returns `vertexes` - vertices that can be passed for rendering and` faces` - roughly speaking, caps that are formed between the vertices and form a polymesh. The library works pretty fast, the speed drops depending on the complexity.

#### [**GlitchDesktop**](https://github.com/AseWhy/glitch-desktop) - Wallpaper for the WE program, using glsl.
Wallpaper for Wallpaper Engine, with a glitch effect, something similar is in the header of the site. Nothing serious, but it looks interesting. Wallpapers can be used on all available WE platforms, and work correctly with all available screen resolutions.

### [**Beyond**](https://vk.com/megacorpparadox) (Заброшен)
A joint project with [**Yan Kuznetsev**](https://vk.com/yankuznetsovvv), which is a chat bot for the VPI game. The bot provided the ability to register in the game, and then use it to accumulate local currency (`bans`), which could be spent on the acquisition of property and businesses that brought passive income. It was also possible to leave the city and go to another. At the time of my release of their project, these are all the possibilities that I managed to realize. The project was abandoned by me due to internal difficulties.
