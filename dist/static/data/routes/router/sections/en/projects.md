# List of projects
In addition to this site, I have a few more projects that I have designed/developed. Here you can find links to representations of these projects, where you can read about them in more detail.

#### [**Poonya**](https://github.com/AseWhy/Poonya) - Text preprocessor.
Nothing fancy, simple, less lightweight text preprocessor. Can be used both on the client and on the server (NodeJS). Of the features, it can be noted that it is not aimed at working with any format and was created exclusively for preliminary text processing. Also, it is quite fast if you use it on the server, and although there are still problems with optimizing its work on the client, they will be gradually fixed.

### [**BlurJS**](https://github.com/AseWhy/blur.canvas.js) - Library for blurring images
A small library for blurring an image, completely useless from a practical point of view, but interesting ...

### [**Beyond**](https://vk.com/megacorpparadox) (Abandoned)
A joint project with [**Yan Kuznetsev**](https://vk.com/yankuznetsovvv), which is a chat bot for the VPI game. The bot provided the ability to register in the game, and then use it to accumulate local currency (`bans`), which could be spent on the acquisition of property and businesses that brought passive income. It was also possible to leave the city and go to another. At the time of my release of their project, these are all the possibilities that I managed to realize. The project was abandoned by me due to internal difficulties.
